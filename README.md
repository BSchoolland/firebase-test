# Firebase Test
This repo was created as a very basic test of firebase, but may turn into more of a real time messaging app in the future.  

## Setup
first, clone or fork the repo, then
use 
``` bash
npm install
```
to install dependencies and 
``` bash
node app.js
``` 
to run the app.  Finally, go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the project running!
